# Documentation

A good starting point is the vignette, available as an Rmd file in the vignette/ subdirectory, or as a [built html page](http://rpubs.com/lwaldron/MultiAssayExperiment). A definition of the API is available by typing `API()` after loading the MultiAssayExperiment library, which opens the [API wiki](https://github.com/vjcitn/MultiAssayExperiment/wiki/MultiAssayExperiment-API).

# Introduction

This repo is intended to start the Bioconductor special interest group
on mergeable experiment collections like TCGA.  Our objective is to use R/Bioconductor
to define interfaces allowing efficient selection and combination of 
high-dimensional assays obtained on all or many members of a group of
samples or patients.

If you are interested in joining this interest group, please join the [MultiAssayExperiment Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biocmultiassay), and see the [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9ar0qc8mpkv6b9intgmdcdf0ss%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) of upcoming meetings.

# Object documentation & Manual Generation

For convenience, the Roxygen2 package functions are used for documenting
and generating R objects and manual pages for this package. More information
can be found at [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html)
