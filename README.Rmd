## Installation

We recommend installing the stable release version of MultiAssayExperiment in
Bioconductor. This can be done using `BiocManager`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("MultiAssayExperiment")
```

## Schematic

Here is a visual overview of the `MultiAssayExperiment` class.
The three main components are:

* `colData` - phenotype data
* `ExperimentList` - a list of tables from experimental results
* `sampleMap` - a graph representation of 'samples' and 'participants'

_Note_. For simplicity, we use the terms 'samples' and 'participants' to
elucidate the relationship although `MultiAssayExperiment` can work on other
biological specimens.

```{r, out.height = "354px", out.width = "384px", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "MultiAssayExperiment schematic"}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/MultiAssayExperiment.png")
```

## Cheatsheet

## Ready-to-use `MultiAssayExperiment` objects

For easy-to-use and ready-made MultiAssayExperiment objects, use the
`curatedTCGAData` experiment data package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("curatedTCGAData")
```

## Companion package for working with TCGA data

TCGAutils is a handy package for working with `MultiAssayExperiment` data
objects from `curatedTCGAData`. It is highly recommended to use `TCGAutils` for
identifier manipulation, sample identification and more.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("TCGAutils")
```

## Documentation

The `MultiAssayExperiment` API is available by browsing to the
[API wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayExperiment/wiki/MultiAssayExperiment-API).

## The `MultiAssayExperiment` Bioconductor Special Interest Group

This group meets remotely to discuss this project approximately every 3 weeks.
If you are interested, please join the
[MultiAssayExperiment Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biocmultiassay)
and see the
[calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9ar0qc8mpkv6b9intgmdcdf0ss%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
of upcoming meetings.
